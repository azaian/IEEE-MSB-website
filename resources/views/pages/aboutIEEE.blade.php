                <p>

                    <span class="ieee">IEEE</span>, an association dedicated to advancing innovation and technological
                    excellence for the benefit
                    of humanity, is the world’s largest technical professional society. It is designed to serve
                    professionals involved in all aspects of the electrical, electronic, and computing fields and
                    related areas of science and technology that underlie modern civilization.

                    <span class="ieee">IEEE</span>’s roots go back to 1884 when electricity began to become a major
                    influence in society. There
                    was one major established electrical industry, the telegraph, which since the 1840s had come to
                    connect the world with a data communications system faster than the speed of transportation. The
                    telephone and electric power and light industries had just gotten underway.
